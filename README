FatController - Parallel execution handler
Copyright (C) 2010-2011 Nicholas Giles

What is it?
-----------

The Fat Controller is used to repeatedly run other programs, usually scripts, a
bit like CRON.   Unlike CRON, it is able to run many instances of a program or
script in parallel making it ideal for executing scripts that process queues or
perform tasks which must be repeated.

The Fat Controller was originally written to run PHP scripts as PHP has
somewhat limited and rather creaky support for process control, but can be used
to run anything.
